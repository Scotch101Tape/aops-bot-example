# Aops Bot Example

This is a simple example of how to use node.js and puppeteer to interact with AoPS to send a PM.

## What it does

The main script (`src/index.js`) sends a pm to the `AOPS_PM_URL` with the AoPS account assciated with `AOPS_USERNAME` and `AOPS_PASSWORD` (In the .env file).

## Setup

### Setup yarn

Run `yarn install`

### Configure the .env

Make a .env file following the format of the `.sample-env`.

### Run the main file

Run `yarn main`
